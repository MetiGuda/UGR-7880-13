        <h1>ABOUT THIS SITE</h1>
        <p>We have a wide variety of colorful life thanks to nature. It would be dull to live in a world without
          animals, birds, and insects.
          Animals and birds play an important role in our environment. They are our neighbors, cohabitants, and
          partners. Due to their role in
          maintaining ecology's balance, they are very noticeable. They cannot be disregarded. There are domesticated
          and wild animals. Some
          animals were domesticated by humans for specific purposes.</p>

        <p>The focus of this website is wild animals. You can discover information about their habitats, parts and
          anatomy, diets, and much more.
          The term <strong>"Wild Animal"</strong> refers to animals that are not normally domesticated. Forests are the
          typical habitat for wild animals.
          Elephants, tigers, lions, rhinos, bears, and other large wild animals are among the most common. Wild animals
          are living resources
          that will eventually die and be replaced by others of their kind. In addition to being valuable in and of
          themselves, animals and plants also contribute to a larger natural environment by serving
          as a source of food, shelter, water, and other necessities for both people and other animals. They are crucial
          in maintaining the environment's balance and
          giving stability to various natural processes. There is a lot more to wildlife than what is covered on this
          website.</p>

        <i>Most of the data on this website, if not all of it, is common knowledge in science and sourced from the
          internet. <b>Into the Wild</b>
          will be updated and expanded on frequent basis. In the near future, new animal categories are planned.</i>
