    <h1>About Birds</h1>
  </section>
  <article class="para">
    <p>Birds are very unique creatures with unique traits that they all share. For instance,
      each of them has two legs, wings, and feathers. Similarly, all birds lay eggs and are warm-blooded.
      They come in a variety of breeds and are very important to our environment. Birds are vertebrates, which means
      they have a
      backbone and are the only vertebrates that have feathers. They can keep their body temperature
      constant regardless of the temperature of their surroundings because they have warm blood.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Birds can eat insects and other small animals
      with the help of their beaks. Some birds, like
      parrots, are capable of grabbing fruit or nuts
      with their beaks. The majority of birds construct
      nests in which they lay their eggs and live in
      flocks (in groups).</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Ornithology</strong>, the study of birds, is so sectionerse
      that it is impossible to even estimate how many
      different kinds of birds there are in the world.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Around 10,000 different bird species can be found
      worldwide. According to scientists, there may be
      even more that hasn't been identified or discovered
      yet. From the Arctic to the tropics, birds can be found on
      every continent and in every type of habitat.
      They come in a variety of amazing colors.
      Ducks, chickens, hawks, eagles, finches, sparrows,
      and crows are a few examples of common bird species.
      While each bird has distinctive qualities of its own,
      all birds have some things in common.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For instance, all birds have feathers and can fly
      (with the exception of a few bird species that have
      lost this ability). One characteristic that distinguishes
      them from other animals is their ability to fly, which is
      made possible by their wings.</p>

        <p class="card-text">
        <p>The <strong>blue jay</strong> <em>(Cyanocitta cristata)</em> is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae,
          native to eastern North America. It lives in most of the eastern and central United States; some eastern
          populations may be migratory. </p>
        <p>Its coloration is predominantly blue, with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black,
          U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and
          plumage, and plumage does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies have been recognized.</p>
        <p>The blue jay feeds mainly on seeds and nuts, such as acorns, which it may hide to eat later;[2] soft fruits;
          arthropods; and occasionally small vertebrates. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground,
          and sometimes hawks insects from the air. </p>

        <p class="card-text">
        <p>Flamingos are famous for their bright pink feathers, stilt-like legs, and S-shaped neck.</p>
        <p>When a flamingo spots potential dinner—favorite foods include shrimp, snails, and plantlike water organisms
          called algae—it plunges its head into the water, twists it upside down, and scoops the fish using its upper
          beak like a shovel. They are able to "run" on water, thanks to their webbed feet, to gain speed before lifting
          up into the sky. </p>
        <p>They build nests that look like mounds of mud along waterways. At the top of the mound, in a shallow hole,
          the
          female lays one egg. The parents take turns sitting on the egg to keep it warm. After about 30 days, the egg
          hatches.</p>

        <p>The <strong>keel-billed toucan</strong> <em>(Ramphastos sulfuratus)</em> is a colorful Latin American
          member of the toucan family. It is the national bird of Belize. The species is found in tropical jungles
          from southern Mexico to Colombia. It is an omnivorous forest bird that feeds on fruits, seeds, insects,
          invertebrates, lizards, snakes, and small birds and their eggs.</p>

        <p>Peacocks are ground-feeders that eat insects, plants, and small creatures. There are two familiar peacock
          species. The blue peacock lives in India and Sri Lanka, while the green peacock is found in Java and Myanmar
          (Burma). A more distinct and little-known species, the Congo peacock, inhabits African rain forests.</p>

        <p>Peafowl such as the blue peacock have been admired by humans and kept as pets for thousands of years.
          Selective breeding has created some unusual color combinations, but wild birds are themselves bursting with
          vibrant hues. They can be testy and do not mix well with other domestic birds.</p>

        <p>There's nothing flashier than a scarlet macaw, making it a popular large bird among fanciers and novices
          alike. It's not unusual for someone to begin his or her pet bird journey with a scarlet, though this bird is
          often not a great choice for the novice. The scarlet is just so gorgeous and filled with personality, it’s
          tough for someone with a few extra bucks in their pocket to refuse.</p>

        <p class="card-text">
        <p>The <strong>golden pheasant</strong> <em>(Chrysolophus pictus)</em>, also known as the <strong>Chinese
            pheasant</strong> , <strong>rainbow pheasant</strong> , is a gamebird of the order Galliformes (gallinaceous
          birds) and the family Phasianidae (pheasants)</p>
        <p>They feed on the ground on grain, leaves and invertebrates, but they roost in trees at night. During winter,
          flocks tend to forage close to human settlements at the edge of forest, taking primarily wheat leaves and
          seeds. While they can fly clumsily in short bursts, they prefer to run and spend most of their time on the
          ground.</p>

        <p class="card-text">
        <p>A distinctive, tall, long-legged, crane-like raptor with unique quill-like plumes on its head and
          bright-red
          facial skin. In flight, the dark edge to the hind wing, diamond-shaped tail, and long spatulate tail
          feathers
          make it unmistakable. It prefers open rangeland and savanna, where it strides about hunting for reptiles,
          small mammals, and insects, which it bludgeons with its powerful legs.</p>
